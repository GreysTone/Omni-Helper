# Omni Helper



For all those who love GTD and OmniFocus, we provide two helpful tools to make their life easier.



* `TimeCheck.omnijs`: It will sum up the time consumption for all selected tasks. You can use it to know You can know how long the tasks scheduled for today will take. Then you can check whether there are too many tasks or you still have some time to do more things.
* `Slice2Pices.omnijs`: It can split a big task (also based on time consumption) into several pieces and let you manage it more flexibly. For example, you can break one three-hour reading down into three one-hour reading tasks.
